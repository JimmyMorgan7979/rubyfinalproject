This app is for my Code Louisville final project.

This app used to input/edit/delete/view customer jobs for a repair shop.

The app tracks the following:
	* Job id number
	* Model number being repaired
	* Start (input) date
	* Completion, due date
	* Employee who is assigned to the work
	* Team assignment who will be responsible for completing the work 
 
The app will allow you to see a jobs overview, allow you to add more jobs to the list, 
edit an exising job, and also to delete jobs upon completion.
